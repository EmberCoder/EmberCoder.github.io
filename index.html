      <!--Information-->
        <p>Harry Potter is a series known widely around the world. It is about a boy named Harry Potter. He lives a life with the Dursleys (Dudley Dursley, his cousin, Petunia Dursley, his aunt, and Vernon Dursley, his uncle.) He is mistreated by them, and Dudley gets everything that he wants. However, Harry turns out to be a wizard, and he likes the wizarding world. Of course, this is a very short explanation and there are many other events, but read the books if you want to know about that! Anyway, many of you may be wondering, exactly how did the Harry Potter series come to be? What was J.K. Rowling thinking when she made it and what was her life before the Harry Potter series? Well read on to find answers to all these questions and more!</p>
        <p>Did you know that J.K Rowling started out very poor? She struggled to get food, especially because she had a baby. She got government checks to help with food and rent, but oftentimes this was only enough to feed Jessica, her baby, and Jo (which was J.K Rowling's real name) remained hungry. However, she did love to write, but hadn't published any books yet, and didn't really have a job. 
        <p>Jo came up with the idea of Harry Potter in a train. She says that it just popped into her head: A young boy with glasses and a scar. She soon came up with many ideas about Harry Potter, and started writing it all down. She thought of Ron because of a real friend that she had who was always kind to her. She came up with the idea of Quidditch because she got mad at someone. She wanted to throw a large piece of metal at them. Then she thought of being on a broomstick while doing that!</p>
        <p>Once she wrote the story, she decided to try and get it published. She went to one company and sent an agent the first few chapters of her story. The agent didn't like the chapters, but Jo wasn't going to give up. She had worked so hard to make the book, so she went to a different company. This time, the agent liked the story, and sent it to a publisher. Jo was very excited as anyone would be when their book got published, but think about how <em>she,</em> in particular,  must have felt. Remember, she was very poor and without a job, and now she was going to become an author. That must have been a great feeling for her. After the book was selling in the UK, Jo got a great surprise. People in the US also wanted to read her books. They wanted them so much, that companies were having contests to buy the book. </p>

        <p>One man fron Scholastic won the book. He loved the book and knew that kids from the United States would love it, too. Jo became very rich off of her book. Many children in the United States loved the book. Jo wrote even more Harry Potter books, and book stores even had parties every time a new Harry Potter book came out. Jo went from being very poor, to being very successful and rich. That is how the Harry Potter series came to be.</p>
